# DASARI VENKATA SAI RAM
## Dwithis Food Court
It's a very nice place to **dine in**. There is park behind this restaurant where we guy's make much fun all the time. And the restaurant has good place for children to play. As it is very **hyginic place** we prefered to go there all the time during our free time.

# Data Structures
> A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.<br>
For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.<br>

    void make_set(int v) {
    parent[v] = v;
                         }

    int find_set(int v) {
    if (v == parent[v])
        return v;
    return find_set(parent[v]);
                     }
