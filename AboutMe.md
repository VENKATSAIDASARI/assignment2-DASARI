> A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.<br>
For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.<br>

    void make_set(int v) {
    parent[v] = v;
                         }

    int find_set(int v) {
    if (v == parent[v])
